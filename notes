Pitch to Frequency

- Subjective perception of frequency

- F(p) = [2^((p-69)/12)] * 440

- F(p+1) / F(p) = 2^(1/12) = 1.059

- Octave divided in 1200 cents

- 100 cents in a semitone

- Noticeable pitch difference: 10-25 cents
----------------------------------------

Sound Power
- rate at which energy is transferred
- energy per unit of time emitted by a
  sound source in a directions
- measured in watt(W)

Sound Intensity
- sound power per unit area
- Measured in W/m^2

Threshold of hearing
- TOH = 10^(-12) W/m^2

Threshold of pain
- TOP = 10 W/m^2

Intensity Level
- Logarithmic scale
- Measured in decibels(dB)
- Ratio between two intensity values
- Use an intensity of reference
- dB(I) = 10 * log(I / I(TOH))

Loudness
- Subjective perception of sound intensity
- Depends on duration / frequency of a sound
- Depends on age
- Measured in phons

Timbre
- Colour of sound
- Diff between two sounds with same intensity,
  frequency, duration
- Described with words like: bright, dark, dull,
  harsh, warm
- Timbre is multidimensional
- Distribution of energy across partials
- Sound envelope - Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release(ADSR) Model
- Harmonic content - Complex sound - * Superposition of sinusoids
                                     * A partial is a sinusoid used to
                                       describe a sound
                                     * The lowest partial is called
                                       fundamental frequency
                                     * A harmonic partial is a frequency
                                       that's a multiple of the fundamental
                                       frequency
                                     * Inharmonicity indicates a deviation
                                       from a harmonic partial
- Frequency modulation - * AKA vibrato
                         * Periodic variation in frequency
                         * In music, used for expressive purposes
- Amplitude modulation - * AKA tremolo
                         * Periodic variation in amplitude
                         * In music, used for expressive purposes

Analog Signal
- Continuous values for time
- Continuous values for amplitude

Digital Signal
- Sequence of discrete values
- Data points can only take on a finite number of values

Analog to digital conversion(ADC)
- Sampling
- Quantization

Sampling
- Sampling Period(T)
- Locating samples(t(n) = n * T)
- Sampling Rate(Sr = 1 / T)
- Why sampling rate = 44100hz for CD ? - * Nyquist frequency(f(N) = Sr / 2)
                                         * 44100 / 2 = 22050 (for CD)

Quantization
- Resolution = num. of bits
- Bit depth
- CD resolution = 16 bits

Dynamic range
- Difference between largest / smallest signal a
  system can record

Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio
- Relationship between max signal strength and
  quantization error
- Correlates with dynamic range
- SQNR(dB) = 6.02 * Q(bit depth)

Signal Domain
- Time domain
- Frequency domain
- Time-frequency representation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frames
- Perceivable audio chunk
- Power of 2 num. samples
- Typical values: 256 - 8192

From time to frequency domain
Spectral leakage
- Processed signal isn't an integer number of periods
- Endpoints are discontinuous
- Discontinuities appear as high-frequency components not
  present in the original signal
- Solve - Windowing - * Apply windowing function(ex: Hann window) to each frame
                      * Eliminates samples at both ends of a frame
                      * Generates a periodic signal
                      * ! Problem : lose signals - Solve - * Overlapping frames

Time-domain features
- Amplitude envelope(AE) - * Max amplitude value of all samples in a frame
                           * Gives rough idea of loudness
                           * Sensitive to outliers
                           * Onset detection, music genre classification

- Root-mean-square energy(RMS) - * RMS of all samples in a frame
                                 * Indicator of loudness
                                 * Less sensitive to outliers than AE
                                 * Audio segmentation, music genre classification

- Zero-crossing rate(ZCR) - * Number of times a signal crosses the horizontal axis
                            * Recognition of percussive vs pitched sounds
                            * Monophonic pitch estimation
